 //
 // It also keeps `npm run test:chat` deterministic. The suite replays 220
 // cases with no history, so every one of them takes the regex path and
 // asserts on curated prose, which a composed answer would not contain.
 //
 // Third, a MATCHED question asked in another language. The pattern placed
 // it on an approved topic, and the curated answer is the right content in
 // the wrong language, so the model is handed the same shortlist and told to
 // answer in the language the question used. If it fails, the English answer
 // is served exactly as before: a worse reply, never a wrong one.
 //
 // An UNMATCHED question in another language is not eligible, and that is
 // not an oversight. The guards are written in English, so "उसके क्लाइंट का
